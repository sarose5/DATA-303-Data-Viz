            <h2>The primary goal of this project is to analyze people who I know that I run
                into on a weekly basis at William & Mary. Factors such as when I encountered them, where I
                encountered them, how often I had seen them during the week of data collection, their gender, and their
                relationship to me are taken into account.
                The secondary goal of this project is to present the data in three different ways with three different focuses
                and see if that reveals any new information. First, I made a scatterplot in Plotly 
                Express that features data points growing and moving to the left depending on when I encountered that 
                person that week, and the size determines how many times I had encountered them that week. The second
                visualization was made in Tableau, and focuses on where I saw these people over the course of seven days. 
                I used Tableau's scatterplot and added a bar graph tooltip on hover-over. The final visualization I made by
                hand in the same vein as Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec did for their <a href="http://www.dear-data.com/all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dear Data project</a>.
                This visualization focuses on when I encountered the person I knew.

        <h1>How Many Times Did I Encounter Someone This Week?</h1>

        <h2>This is a Plotly Express scatterplot. On the y-axis I have the fourteen different people I encountered this week, and 
            on the x-axis I have the amount of times I saw them this week. This visualization is meant to show which days 
            I saw them over the course of data collection, and how many times I saw them. Everytime the size of a point 
            increases, that represents another time I saw them that week. This visualization shows the breakdown of people 
            seen each day, and has the most seen people highlighted due to their size. Most people I only saw once or 
            twice during the week, but there were a few people I ran into three times. This visualization was interesting,
            because the idea of "racing data points" actually came to me from a game played with my friends where our characters
            had to travel from the left of the screen to the right, and the first one to the right won the game. I thought
            it would be interesting to try and show the same phenomena with the data points moving to the right and the 
            "winners" being the points with the largest size.

        <h2>This is a visualization I drew myself using pencils and some colored pens. As stated before, I was inspired by 
            the work done on the Dear Data Project. This visualization is meant to show when I saw people over the week 
            of data collection. As written in the "How To Read It" portion, each line represents an hour of my typical day, 
            and the shapes represent an encounter. You can see dry spots in the data around 11am and 1pm, and hotspots around 
            9am, 3pm and 4pm. I was worried about this visualization, since I am not an artist, but after erasing many
            drafts and after getting a ruler, it turned out better than I expected.

        <h2>This first link will take you to a public Tableau dashboard with my third visualization.
            This visualization aims to focus on where I encountered people during my week of data collection. 
            This is technically another scatterplot according to Tableau, but it is much different than the one
            from Plotly Express. This visualization reveals that most of the recognized encounters happened in
            the lobby of my apartment, and around the walkways by the Swem library, Andrews Hall, and Jones Hall. 
            This visualization also includes a tooltip which uses a bar graph to show the gender and type of person
            breakdown for each area. This visualization was fun to make, and I think the hover tooltips provide good
            summary data, without being too intrusive.

        <h2>This second link will take you to a public Tableau dashboard with my fourth and final visualization.
            This visualization also focuses on where I encountered people during the data collection week, but in a
            much more literal sense. This visualization uses latitude and longitude coordinates to show exactly where
            I had the encounters, as well as the area I was in during the data collection period. The map the visualization
            uses is also split up between Students, Professors, and Neither, showing a clear difference in where I encounter
            types of people. The process of making this visualization required getting some coordinate data, but other than 
            that, it was pretty straightforward.
