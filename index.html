            <h2>The primary goal of this project is to analyze people who I know that I run
                into on a weekly basis at William & Mary. Factors such as when I encountered them, where I
                encountered them, how often I had seen them during the week of data collection, their gender, and their
                relationship to me are taken into account.
                The secondary goal of this project is to present the data in three different ways with three different focuses
                and see if that reveals any new information. First, I made a scatterplot in Plotly 
                Express that features data points growing and moving to the left depending on when I encountered that 
                person that week, and the size determines how many times I had encountered them that week. The second
                visualization was made in Tableau, and focuses on where I saw these people over the course of seven days. 
                I used Tableau's scatterplot and added a bar graph tooltip on hover-over. The final visualization I made by
                hand in the same vein as Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec did for their <a href="http://www.dear-data.com/all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dear Data project</a>.
                This visualization focuses on when I encountered the person I knew.

        <h2>This is a Plotly Express scatterplot. On the y-axis I have the fourteen different people I encountered this week, and 
            on the x-axis I have the amount of times I saw them this week. This visualization is meant to show which days I saw them 
            over the course of data collection, and how many times I saw them. Everytime the size of a point increases, that represents
            another time I saw them that week. This visualization shows the breakdown of people seen each day, and has the most seen people
            highlighted due to their size. Most people I only saw once or twice during the week, but there were a 
            few people I ran into three times.

        <h2>This is a visualization I drew myself using pencils and some colored pens. As stated before, I was inspired by the work done
            on the Dear Data Project. This visualization is meant to show when I saw people over the week of data collection. As written
            in the "How To Read It" portion, each line represents an hour of my typical day, and the shapes represent an encounter. You can see dry
            spots in the data around 11am and 1pm, and hotspots around 9am, 3pm and 4pm.

        <h2>The link above will take you to a public Tableau dashboard with my third and final visualization.
            This visualization aims to focus on where I encountered people during my week of data collection. 
            This is technically another scatterplot according to Tableau, but it is much different than the one
            from Plotly Express. This visualization reveals that most of the recognized encounters happened in
            the lobby of my apartment, and around the walkways by the Swem library, Andrews Hall, and Jones Hall.
